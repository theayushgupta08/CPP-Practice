# üíª C++ Practice Codes

This repository contains my **C++ practice programs** written while learning and revising concepts of C++ programming.  
It includes a wide range of topics, from **basic syntax** to **advanced projects**, **DSA**, and even **graphics programming**.

  - Input/Output, loops, conditionals, functions  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
  - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching  
- **File Handling**  
  - Reading & writing files  
- **Small Projects**  
  - Management systems (Automobile, Library, Hospital, etc.)  
  - Mini utilities  
- **Graphics Programming**  
  - Using `<graphics.h>` for creating simple windows and shapes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install a C++ compiler (`g++`, MinGW, or Turbo C++ with graphics support).
- Use an IDE (Dev C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio) or terminal to compile and run.

### Running a File
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theayushgupta08/CPP-Practice.git
   cd CPP-Practice-Codes

2. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o output

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
    ./output
